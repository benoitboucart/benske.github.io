{"content":"<p>This article is a - non-exhaustive - overview of available free CMS that I’ve tested or that are promising.</p>\n<h2>Free PHP CMS</h2>\n<ol>\n    <li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"><strong>ProcessWire</strong>\nI haven't had the possibility to test <strong>ProcessWire</strong> yet but it looks to be a great and user friendly solution. It is focused on \"custom fields\" (like text, numbers, images, ...) and pages (in fact \"templates\") can have their different fields. Their API is also powerful, so the possibilities of <strong>ProcessWire</strong> seem to be endless! </span></span>Some interesting links about ProcessWire: <a title=\"Make a basic website with Processwire (tutorial)\" href=\"http://wiki.processwire.com/index.php/Basic_Website_tutorial\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Basic Website tutorial</em></a>,  <em><a title=\"Get inspired by websites using ProcessWire CMS (portfolio)\" href=\"http://processwire.com/about/sites/\" target=\"_blank\">get inspired by sites using ProcessWire</a></em>, <em><a title=\"tutorial Processwire\" href=\"http://processwire.com/talk/topic/693-small-project-walkthrough-planets/\" target=\"_blank\">Small Project Walkthrough</a></em> and <em><a title=\"Pages in ProcessWire explained\" href=\"http://wiki.processwire.com/index.php/Pages\" target=\"_blank\">the concept of ProcessWire pages explained</a></em>.</li>\n    <li><strong>Concrete5</strong>\n\"<em>CMS made for Marketing but built for Geeks</em>\". That's the CMS I used for my <a title=\"Benoît Boucart portfolio\" href=\"http://webbb.be\" target=\"_blank\">personal portfolio</a>. Concrete5 is very <strong>user friendly</strong> because it's possibile to edit your pages directly in the <strong>front-end</strong>. A page contains different blocks that are easy to customise and to create. One great free plugin for <em>Concrete5</em> is \"<a title=\"Designer Content plugin for Concrete5\" href=\"http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/designer-content/\" target=\"_blank\">Designer Content</a>\", it let you create custom block types (that can contain different types like <em>text, files, ...</em>) via a simple admin interface.</li>\n    <li><strong>WordPress\n</strong>WordPress is definitely the best <strong>blogging</strong> platform. As a CMS it has, however, some shortcomings. But WordPress has a very <strong>large community</strong> with a lot of (free) plugins available that you can easily integrate into your websites. Some of those <a title=\"40 Exceptional “CMS Enabling” WordPress Plugins\" href=\"http://www.noupe.com/wordpress/wordpress-cms-plugins.html\" target=\"_blank\">plugins can make WordPress a better CMS</a>. Another great article about WordPress as a CMS is: \"<a title=\"The Autopsy Of WordPress As CMS With 25 Great WP Plugins &amp; Designs\" href=\"http://www.onextrapixel.com/2009/07/17/the-autopsy-of-wordpress-as-cms-with-25-great-wp-plugins-designs/\" target=\"_blank\">The Autopsy Of WordPress As CMS With 25 Great WP Plugins &amp; Designs</a>\".</li>\n    <li><strong>Joomla</strong> is a very powerful CMS with many options (maybe too many for simple websites). The disadvantage of <em>Joomla</em> is that it can be complicated to add custom code. But, like WordPress, it remains very popular so there are a lot of free \"components\" and \"plugins\" available that are ready to use.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Other free CMS that are worth mentioning</h2>\n<ol>\n    <li><a title=\"Drupal\" href=\"http://drupal.org\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Drupal</span></a></li>\n    <li><a title=\"CMS Made Simple\" href=\"http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CMSMadeSimple</a></li>\n    <li><a title=\"SilverStripe\" href=\"http://www.silverstripe.org\" target=\"_blank\">SilverStripe</a></li>\n    <li><a title=\"CushyCMS\" href=\"http://www.cushycms.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cushy CMS</a></li>\n    <li><a title=\"MODx\" href=\"http://modx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MODx</a></li>\n    <li><a title=\"List of content management systems\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems#PHP\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia list of PHP Content Management Systems</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another CMS that is worth mentioning, but that isn’t a <em>free PHP CMS</em> is <strong>Perch </strong>(<a title=\"Example website using Perch CMS\" href=\"https://github.com/PerchCMS/PerchExample-24ways2012\" target=\"_blank\">source code of a website that is using Perch</a> and <a title=\"Example of Perch website (blog, events, layouts)\" href=\"https://github.com/PerchCMS/PerchExample-rachelandrew_me\" target=\"_blank\">another example with layouts</a>). It is really easy to use and to customise.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, why not create your <a title=\"tutorial for making your first simple CMS\" href=\"http://css-tricks.com/php-for-beginners-building-your-first-simple-cms/\" target=\"_blank\">own custom PHP CMS</a>?</p>\n"}
