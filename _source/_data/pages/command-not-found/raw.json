{"content":"<p>To give you a little context: I ran the following command for installing Gulp (a <i>node package module</i>) globally:\n<code>npm install -g gulp</code></p>\n\n<p>The installation succeed but when I ran this command <code>gulp</code> in the command line I got a <code>\"gulp: command not found\"</code> error. It appeared that it installed “Gulp” in my local folder that is <code>/Users/YOURUSERNAME/node_modules</code> and not in the <b>global NPM folder</b>.</p>\n\n<p>You can check this by running this command: <code>npm root</code> or <code>npm root -g</code>, which was returning my personal directory <code>/Users/YOURUSERNAME/node_modules</code> and not the expected <code>/usr/local/lib/node_modules</code>.</p>\n\n<p>With some trial &amp; error, I finally found the solution. You have to change the “<i>npm config prefix</i>” like so:\n<code>npm config set prefix /usr/local</code></p>\n\n<p>Then when I re-ran <code>npm root -g</code>, I got the correct root folder:\n<code>/usr/local/lib/node_modules</code></p>\n\n<p>When I reinstalled Gulp globally (with the <code>-g</code> param) it finally worked and appeared that it was now correctly installed in the global NPM folder!</p>\n"}
