**Sketch.app** is gaining constantly popularity the latest months. This was a reason for me for trying out this app. You can download a [Free trial of Sketch]("http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch" "30-day free trial").

## What is Sketch exactly?
> "Sketch is a professional vector graphics app with a beautiful interface and powerful tools. We set out to build a better app for graphic designers. Not to copy, but rather to improve."

Some advantages of Sketch are:

- Sketch is created for <strong>UI designers</strong>, where Photoshop hasn't this purpose.
- It works with **vectors**
- **Democratic price**: $49,99 dollars
