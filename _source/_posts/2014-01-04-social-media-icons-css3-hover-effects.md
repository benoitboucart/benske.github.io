subtitle: With CSS 3D hover effects
description: I created a new CSS3 3D hover effect for **social media** icons. The result can be seen, as usual, on Dabblet. It uses CSS3 transitions, transforms and 3D properties.

I used the great [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) (webfont for icons) library for the Social Media icons.

<img class="full-item alignnone size-large wp-image-504" alt="CSS social media hover effect 3D" src="http://webbb.be/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/social-media-hover-effects-1024x491.png" width="482" height="239" />

> Please note that the CSS in Dabblet (see the demo below) is unprefixed, this is because Dabblet has a nice <code>-prefix-free</code> feature that automatically adds the correct prefixes in the result.
